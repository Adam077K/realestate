# design-screen — Realestate Design Operating System Workflow

The ultracode orchestration script for the Realestate design pipeline. One screen in, one
craft-validated screen out, graded against the founder's reference folder.

## What it does

Encodes the `REFERENCE -> DIRECTION -> BUILD -> VALIDATE(loop)` pipeline as a
deterministic `.claude/workflows` Workflow. Given a screen name, it:

1. Loads the screen's reference contract (`docs/design/references/[screen]/`) plus the
   global product-feel set (`docs/design/references/_product-feel/`) — references are
   **vibe, not blueprint** — and design-lead distills the **DIRECTION** here (the one
   memorable element, the primary layout move, the motion-budget tier). The DIRECTION
   stage of the pipeline runs inside this first phase, feeding the build.
2. Runs the dedicated front-end **product-designer** to BUILD the screen in Realestate's own
   design language.
3. Runs a **design-critic <-> design-polisher** loop: the critic grades CRAFT-PARITY &
   FEELING vs the references (never 1:1 copy-fidelity); the polisher closes the named
   craft gaps. Repeat until PASS or the round cap, then escalate to the founder.
4. Returns the validated screen + Playwright screenshots and the final critic verdict.

## How to invoke

Run via the **Workflow** tool with the registered name and the screen name as args:

```
Workflow(name: "design-screen", args: "dashboard")
Workflow(name: "design-screen", args: "home")
```

`args` is the screen slug — it must match a folder under `docs/design/references/[screen]/`.
The script is plain JavaScript run by the workflow harness; `agent`, `parallel`,
`pipeline`, `phase`, `log`, and `args` are injected globals (async context — `await`
directly). Wall-clock and randomness are unavailable inside the harness.

## Founder checkpoints (3 — the script PAUSES and escalates, never auto-continues)

1. **LOCK the reference folder** — before any build. The visual contract that captures
   taste. The script verifies the folder exists; if it is missing/empty it stops and
   asks the founder to populate `docs/design/references/[screen]/` + `REFERENCE.md`.
2. **~50% FIRST-PAINT build** — after the designer's first build, before the polish loop
   grinds. The script surfaces the first-paint screenshots for the founder to react to.
3. **JUDGE the final** — the validated screen + screenshots are returned for the
   founder's final approval. PASS from the critic is necessary, not sufficient.

The harness cannot block on human input mid-run, so each checkpoint is emitted as a
`log()` narrator line + a structured `checkpoint` field in the result. The CEO/design-lead
relays it to the founder and re-invokes if changes are requested.

## Runtime mode

Subagents cannot spawn subagents (nested Task is blocked), so this Workflow is the
deterministic orchestrator: it calls `agent(..., { agentType })` for each role directly.
This is the alternative to the design-lead dispatch-packet mode — use the Workflow when
you want the loop run mechanically; use design-lead when a human-in-the-loop chief is
steering. Both are documented in the design OS spec.

PRINCIPLE — references are VIBE, not BLUEPRINT. You catalogue the FEELING, craft level, and
aesthetic confidence to transfer. Cloning layouts 1:1 is forbidden downstream.

Do this:
1. Read every file in "${productFeelDir}" — the GLOBAL whole-product soul, loaded on every screen.
2. Read every file in "${screenRefDir}" — this screen's north-star references + Refero-expanded
   real-pixel screens + REFERENCE.md ("what we steal: the FEELING/move, not the layout").
3. Decide whether the reference folder is LOCKED: it is locked only if "${screenRefDir}" exists,
   is non-empty, and contains a REFERENCE.md. If it is missing or empty, the founder has not yet
   set the visual contract — this is FOUNDER CHECKPOINT #1 and you must stop.

## Loop & checkpoint summary

| Stage | Agent (`agentType`) | Output | Checkpoint |
|-------|---------------------|--------|------------|
| Reference | `design-lead` | locked contract + feeling brief | #1 LOCK (stops if folder unset) |
| Build | `product-designer` | TSX/Tailwind screen + screenshots | — |
| First paint | — | first-paint screenshots surfaced | #2 ~50% FIRST-PAINT |
| Validate loop | `design-critic` -> `design-polisher` | craft-parity verdict + closed gaps | — |
| Judge | — | validated screen + final verdict | #3 JUDGE FINAL |

- **Pipeline shape:** the critic<->polisher loop is sequential by necessity (each polish
  pass depends on the prior critic verdict). `parallel`/`pipeline` are reserved for
  multi-screen runs — fan several screen slugs through this Workflow concurrently, never
  to race the critic against the polisher on one screen.
- **Round cap:** `MAX_ROUNDS = 4`. On cap without PASS the script returns
  `status: "ESCALATED"` rather than shipping unvalidated craft.
- **First application:** the dashboard + home screens.
